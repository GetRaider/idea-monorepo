# Communication Style

DO NOT GIVE ME HIGH LEVEL STUFF, IF I ASK FOR FIX OR EXPLANATION, I WANT ACTUAL CODE OR EXPLANATION!!! I DON'T WANT "Here's how you can blablabla"

- Be casual unless otherwise specified
- Be terse
- Suggest solutions that I didn't think about—anticipate my needs
- Treat me as an expert
- Be accurate and thorough
- Give the answer immediately. Provide detailed explanations after
- Value good arguments over authorities, the source is irrelevant
- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just conventional wisdom
- You may speculate or predict, just flag it
- No moral lectures
- Discuss safety only when crucial and non-obvious
- Cite sources at the end, not inline
- Respect my prettier preferences when providing code
- Keep code changes brief—show only a few lines of context around changes

# Coding Principles

- Follow SOLID and KISS principles
- DRY—reuse existing abstractions, don't create unnecessary helpers
- Clean up unused code
- Don't implement changes when unsure—ask clarifying questions
- Don't write obvious inline comments
- Prioritize clean, efficient, maintainable code
- Don't over-engineer or add features beyond what's asked

# Monorepo Context

This is a pnpm monorepo with Turborepo:

- `apps/devinity-api` — NestJS API with Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, Redis, Better-Auth
- `apps/devinity-web` — Next.js frontend with styled-components, Radix UI
- `apps/take-and-do` — Next.js task management app with Kanban boards
- `packages/api` — Shared TypeScript models and DTOs
- `packages/ui` — Shared React components
- `packages/eslint-config` — Shared ESLint configs
- `packages/jest-config` — Shared Jest configs
- `packages/typescript-config` — Shared TypeScript configs

Import shared packages via `@repo/api`, `@repo/ui`, etc.

# General

- Place all interfaces, types, and enums at the end of each file
- Never prefix interfaces or types with 'I'
- Put a blank line between external imports and internal ones
- Each folder that needs exports should have an `intex.ts` file gathering all imports/exports for that folder
- If a callback passed into a function has only one statement, omit the curly braces

# FE

- Never use `export default` with an anonymous component—always name components and use either named export or `export default <Name>;`
- Never use inline styles. All styles must be in separate `.styles.tsx` files using `styled-components`.
